# Mymory

## A Recursive AI Framework for Self-Reflective Learning and Validator-Governed Adaptation

---

## 🧬 Abstract

**Mymory** is a recursive AI architecture that combines long-term memory (Mymories), modular reasoning, LoRA-based personalization, and a human-in-the-loop validation framework. Designed for autonomy, auditability, and adaptation, it enables AI agents to evolve over time through a structured self-reflection and improvement process. Each learning is validated through a tiered loop and optionally published on-chain via Merkle trees or dNFT anchors for trust and governance.

## 🧠 System Overview

![System Architecture Diagram](System_Architecture_Diagram.png)

### 🔧 Key Modules

* **Reflection Engine** – Introspective loop generating insights and learnings ("Mymories")
* **Validator Loop** – Tiered validation from LLMs to human auditors
* **Mymory Ledger** – Merkle-tree based local or decentralized memory store
* **LoRA Integration** – Spawned, validated, and merged adapters
* **Governance Layer** – Optional DAO or committee oversight
* **Provenance Anchoring** – Optional dNFTs to ensure trust and economic signaling

## 📚 Core Concepts

### ✅ Mymories

Structured memory units storing lessons, validations, metadata, and lineage.

```json
{
  "id": "mymory_20250528_001",
  "content": "Reflected that KCG nodes should use decay logic.",
  "timestamp": "2025-05-28T12:45:00Z",
  "status": "approved",
  "hash": "abc123...",
  "previous_hash": "xyz789..."
}
```

### ✅ Validator Loop

Three tiers:

* **Tier 0**: Fast automated schema checks, hallucination/bias screening
* **Tier 1**: LLM agent validation (factuality, contradiction, ethical review)
* **Tier 2**: Human validator audit interface

Includes escalation, dispute resolution, and audit logging.

### ✅ LoRA Lifecycle

* Per-insight LoRA adapters are created post-validation
* Stored in registry and optionally merged into runtime
* Sleep/Dream cycles control when merges happen

### ✅ Recursive Improvement Loop

1. User interaction
2. Reflection generates Mymory
3. Mymory enters Validator Loop
4. LoRA adapter is trained
5. Adapter is merged or queued for dream phase

## 🔁 Implementation Plan (MVP)

* Workflow orchestrated in `n8n.io`
* Mymories stored in SQLite with optional Avalanche expansion
* LoRA adapters trained using DeepSeek/Mistral stack
* Validator Loop: GPT-4o → Claude 3 → Human UI (Streamlit)
* Weekly runtime:

  * Friday: Sleep cycle & collation
  * Saturday: Human approval phase
  * Sunday night: LoRA training

## 🧪 Sample Artifacts

### 🧠 Mymory Lifecycle Diagram

### 🧾 Validator Prompt (Tier 1)

```json
{
  "factually_accurate": false,
  "confidence": 0.95,
  "explanation": "Capital of Australia is Canberra, not Sydney."
}
```

### 🧑‍💻 Streamlit Snippet (Human UI)

```python
st.header("Human Validation")
st.write(my_memory_content)
st.write(tier1_results)
st.write(lineage)
st.text_area("Edit Mymory")
```

## 🛡️ Ethics & Governance

* Tiered Validator Loop enforces safety
* Optional NIST-compliant flow
* Audit trails logged per validation
* Optional decentralized governance board or DAO

## 💸 Cost Breakdown

| Component                | Cost Estimate | Notes                        |
| ------------------------ | ------------- | ---------------------------- |
| LoRA Training (per unit) | \$20–\$50     | Per adapter                  |
| Validator Review (human) | \$10/hr       | 5–10 min per Mymory          |
| Hosting + Storage        | \~\$300/month | SQLite, Streamlit, LLM usage |
